            <h1>Why accept IELTS scores?</h1>
            <p>As an organisation based in an English-speaking country, it’s imperative that everyone on your team has a high level of English proficiency. Not only is it important for the work carried out internally in your organisation, but for the individual's ability to integrate into the community too.

IELTS is the world's most popular English language test for higher education and global migration. Approximately three million tests are taken every year in over 140 countries.

Moreover, IELTS is the only English language test that is accepted by all key immigration authorities for visa applications and migration purposes. This includes Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the UK.</p>
<h1>IELTS test types</h1>
<p>We offer two types of tests: IELTS Academic and IELTS General Training. The choice offers flexibility for organisations as IELTS Academic is suited to those who will be entering a higher learning environment, whereas IELTS General Training focuses on a test taker’s proficiency in a practical, everyday context.

We want to test individuals in the right areas, so they best fit the needs of your organisation.

Regardless of which IELTS the individual takes, they will be thoroughly assessed on four key areas which include: Listening, Reading, Writing and speaking.</p>
<h1>Test fairness</h1>
<p>IELTS actively avoids cultural bias in order to ensure all test takers are treated with the utmost fairness. The test consists of questions that are relevant to the way people need to use English in their studies or working lives. The topics covered by the test are both interesting and contemporary and are based on an analysis of the ways in which language is used in everyday life.

</p>
<h1>Face-to-face speaking test</h1>
<p>IELTS includes a face-to-face speaking test with a qualified and trained examiner. They will interact and assess the test taker’s communicative skills in English. This prompts a more realistic performance from test takers than simply responding to recorded cues from a computer.

We believe this approach to testing allows institutions and employers to be able to better identify test takers who can communicate effectively in English.

All standard varieties of native English are accepted. This includes Australian English, British English, North American English and New Zealand English.</p>
