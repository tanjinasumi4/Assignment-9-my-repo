### IELTS for work

Providing proof of your language proficiency is an important step in obtaining a visa so that you can work abroad. Language skills are key to career success, and are considered a valuable asset in addition to all the other requirements of any job.
### IELTS for study

If you are interested in studying abroad, remember that many universities worldwide and all universities and colleges in the UK accept IELTS test results.

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
